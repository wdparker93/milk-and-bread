1. Dictionary of US states, zoom levels, and latitude/longitude settings for map
2. Logic for add/remove markers at address
3. Integrate weather API - DONE
4. Need supply volumes of material at locations - DONE
5. Build out database layer and queries.
6. Display list of locations at bottom-right corner with ability to see below parameters
    a. Weather event antipipated and when
    b. Supply at location
    c. Geocode/address from Geocode
    d. Anticipated sales
    e. Options to trigger reroutes
7. Rerouting algorithm will need to be able to
    a. Identify the "front" where the weather event is going to be.
        i. Also identify where the "front" is headed. 
        ii. Want to know a direction of sorts so appropriate stores that are out of the line of the storm can mobilize inventory appropriately.
    b. Prioritize areas based on urgency. Urgency composed of when weather event is expected and how much money is expected as a result of Rerouting
    c. Use a network of nodes to connect locations and route material from one location to another
    d. Find the most efficient route for rerouting material.
    e. Pull in material from sites further out to backfill material shipped in from other regions (rebalance to hit steady state)
8. Show different icon or additional icon if weather event is anticipated
9. Build network of nodes that will allow creation of a spanning tree/map where the nodes are the stores and the paths are the routes between
10. Want update supply window to flash when Manage Inventory button is clicked for a location.
11. Do an analysis on value proposition if time permits. Get data that correlate weather with sales and show that using predictive analytics makes sense.
12. Be able to add weight(s) to the paths connecting the nodes in the map. Time to traverse path, cost to traverse path.
